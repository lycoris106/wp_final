To make this dish even more convenient to prepare, we used San Miguel Del Mar, which is made from 100% pure, meaty tuna chunks packed with just two other ingredients: water and salt. We love that this new canned tuna has no extenders and no preservatives. Simply pull the easy-open-tab and watch the fleck of oceanic goodness with omega-3 and protein come out!  \r\n\r\nNow, in a hot oiled pan, toss in the leftover rice (leftovers from last night would be best used for this), add a splash of kimchi juice, caramelized onions, and sweet-peppery gochujang sauce. Top this with a sunny side-up egg which is typical of Korean fried rice bowls and tastes best with a runny yolk.",

Since everyone is heading towards kimchi-ing (yes, it\u2019s a verb now) not-so-ordinary ingredients, I thought I\u2019d jump on the bandwagon and take on the challenge.

Curing this juicy red fruit with salt, leeks, garlic, gochugaru (Korean chili pepper flakes), honey as well as carrots, for that additional crunch, results in a savory, sweet and spicy mix that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a traditional banchan spread.

If you\u2019ve seen the record-breaking Korean drama, Crash Landing On You, then you might have caught female protagonist and heiress Yoon Se-Ri munching away on these addictive snacks during her time in the North. Besides using plain white rice, you can mix it up by adding Korean black rice for extra oomph and texture, giving you Korean purple rice. A great alternative to chips and crackers, Nurungji is best eaten with a sprinkle of sugar. You can even try out our brown sugar dip, mixed with toasted sesame seeds and seaweed flakes.",

I\u2019ve come to realize that different countries have slight adjustments to the topping but the base concept is the same. Malaysian Cendol typically has more colourful topping options like creamed corn, durian, red bean, palm seed/attap chee, ground nuts, grass jelly or even ice cream. Meanwhile Singapore Cendol is commonly served with red beans/kidney beans and gula melaka syrup.

Tuna in itself has a pretty distinct salty fishy taste when cooked, and the ground spices in this recipe compliments the strong flavors while providing a nice gravy to pair with rice. This dish packs high levels of heat, so for those who can\u2019t tolerate extremely spicy food, it might be good to reduce the amount of big red chilies used!",

While my recipe uses hazelnut or chocolate spread, and fresh strawberries as toppings, you can choose to pair it with other sauces and fruits of your choice. If you don\u2019t have a waffle maker, you can also use a toaster press or panini press with a griddle attachment - you might not get the signature waffle shape, but it\u2019s hard to complain once you get a taste of the rich buttery crust.

    "content": "My late father first made this Filipino pork peanut stew classic, which everyone in my family loved. It takes quite a while to cook everything, but it\u2019s not too difficult. I start off by making the savory, creamy peanut dip, which is simply a quick blitz of roasted peanuts and oil. I roast them myself, but you can also buy them roasted. The whole pork leg may be a bit clumsy to handle, but the cooking is simple - just boil. The hardest part might be combining everything in a hot pan. For that, I use a glossy red annatto oil for some spiced sweetness (I fry the seeds for the oil, but you can buy the oil too), and let everything sizzle. This old dish is something all locals love, but my father really knew how to make the best one, and I\u2019m glad he taught me too. ",

The long cooking time ensures that the beef becomes tender and releases all of its flavors. To balance out the beefy taste and make this soup even healthier, the dish is traditionally cooked with green leafy vegetables. Serve with rice for a hearty meal.",
