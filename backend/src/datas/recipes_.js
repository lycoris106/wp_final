Salty fish sauce, lightly sweetened with earthy palm sugar forms the broth of this refreshing infusion and pulls the whole thing together. Our way of eating it? Slice the soft-boiled egg in half and first plop in the jammy yolk, tongue down for a creamy mouthfeel, then sip on the broth and repeat for the other half \u2013 this way you get to taste this twice!
